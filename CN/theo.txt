2. **AAAA Record:** Maps a domain to an IPv6 address.
3. **CNAME Record:** Alias one name to another (canonical name).
4. **MX Record:** Specifies mail exchange servers for email services.
5. **TXT Record:** Holds text information, often used for verification purposes.

**Process:**
1. **Query:** A user types a domain name in their browser.
2. **Resolver:** The query goes to a recursive resolver, which queries DNS servers in sequence (root, TLD, authoritative) to get the IP address.
3. **Response:** The IP address is returned to the resolver, which then sends it to the user's device, allowing the browser to connect to the server.

**Advantages:**
- **Ease of Use:** Users can use easy-to-remember domain names instead of numeric IP addresses.
- **Scalability:** Supports a vast number of domains and addresses.
